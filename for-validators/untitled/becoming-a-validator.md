# Becoming a Validator

## Overview:

A Validator is an independent individual who stakes their identity and is entrusted to maintain a node on the network that validates transactions and commits new blocks to the blockchain. Validators receive a reward in POA token for provisioning blocks.

## Responsibilities:

A Validator has technical and social responsibilities, both of which are important for the health, performance and security of the network.

#### Technical Responsibilities:

* Ensure node is secure by practicing safe key management
* Maintain node requisite software version
* Monitor node to ensure its availability and participation in consensus
* Monitor network in general and communicate with other Validators, network entities if problems arise.

#### Social Responsibilities:

* Participate in on-chain Governance of the network. A [collection of DApps ](../validator-dapps/)allow Validators to propose and vote on ballots  to manage the network. The Ballot types include:
  * Adding new Validators
  * Removing Validators, i.e. for compromising security of network, malicious behavior, non-participation in Governance
  * Updating/swapping of one of more Validator keys
  * Changing the Approve Ballot Threshold
  * Changing Consensus Proxy Contract
* Participate in POA Network Community Forum

## Eligibility Requirements for the Sokol Testnet

Candidates start out by posting an application to the forum. After some discussion about their desire to participate in the network, a current validator may nominate a candidate for the Sokol testnet. Current Sokol validators then vote on accepting the candidate. If accepted, the candidate must setup a node in order to become a validator on the testnet.
