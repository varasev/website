# Welcome to POA

POA Network is an autonomous network secured by a group of trusted validators. All validators on the network are United States notaries, and their information is publicly available.  This distributed group of known validators allows the network to provide fast and inexpensive transactions.

POA also develops products and tools to improve interoperability, infrastructure and transparency throughout the ecosystem. These include [BlockScout](https://docs.blockscout.com/), an open-source explorer, [TokenBridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/), a multi-chain asset-transfer solution, and the [xDai Network](https://www.xdaichain.com/), a stable coin based network.

Engaging with POA will help you experience and create a first-class application on our platform. Welcome to POA!

## About our Logo

All POA Projects utilize [Identicon](http://identicon.net/) to generate unique logos. A hash of the project name along with the project color scheme is used to create the visual identity for each project. This creates consistency while highlighting the uniqueness of each project.
