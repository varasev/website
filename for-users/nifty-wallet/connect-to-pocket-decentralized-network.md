# Connect to Pocket Decentralized Network

Nifty allows users to easily connect to a decentralized network rather than strictly through Infura \(as is the case for mainnet interaction with MetaMask\). The [Pocket Network](https://www.pokt.network/) provides access and routes data to full service, decentralized blockchain nodes.

1\) Open Nifty Wallet, connect to your desired network, and select **Settings** from the three-line menu.

1. Select Switch to Decentralized Provider \(Pocket\)
2. Press the back arrow to return to your wallet.

3\) Thats it! Now you can send a transaction as you normally would, and it will be processed with the Pocket Network. Transactions times may increase slightly. Note that not all chains are supported by Pocket: Supported chains include \([see here for a full list](https://docs.pokt.network/docs/supported-networks)\):
