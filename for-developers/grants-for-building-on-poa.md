# Grants for Building on POA

{% hint style="warning" %}
The grants program is not processing new applications at the moment as we are looking for grantors. The program will re-open after Q2 2020.
{% endhint %}

We are actively looking for game developers interested in building on the POA Network. To date, we have provided $50,000.00 in DAI for game development on the network, including funds for GEON, [one of the most popular games in the entire Ethereum ecosystem](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/rankings/category/games), and [Clovers](https://clovers.network/), a new game which will utilize the POA TokenBridge to move transactions between the POA Network and the Ethereum Mainnet.

Please fill out the form below if you are interested in applying for a grant to build the next great game on POA!
