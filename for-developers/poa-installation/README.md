# Full Node Setup

{% hint style="info" %}
You do not need to run your own node to interact with the POA blockchain \(play games, send and receive funds, and use DApps\). Running a node can be thought of as a public service - it benefits the decentralization and overall security of the chain, and allows you to confirm the chain state using your own instance.

* [Nethermind](install-nethermind-client.md)
